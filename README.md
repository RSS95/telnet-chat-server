# Telnet Chat Server

This is basically me reading Beej's Guide to Network Programming (link: http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/) and copying
its telnet server and client program.

I am trying to learn C Programming Language and programming in C and also I am interested in more, creating web-servers
than network programming but learning it is good for understanding web-servers.

So this project will be basically me trying to learn C and network programming, and the secondary goal will be to create
a somewhat working chat web-server along with increasing my understanding of multi-threading.
